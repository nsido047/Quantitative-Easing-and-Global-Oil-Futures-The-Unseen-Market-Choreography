	abstract = {We present evidence on the effects of large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England since 2008. We show that announcements about these purchases led to lower long-term interest rates and depreciations of the U.S. dollar and the British pound on announcement days, while commodity prices generally declined despite this more stimulative ﬁnancial environment. We suggest that LSAP announcements likely involved signaling effects about future growth that led investors to downgrade their U.S. growth forecasts lowering long-term US yields, depreciating the value of the U.S. dollar, and triggering a decline in commodity prices. Moreover, our analysis illustrates the importance of controlling for market expectations when assessing these effects. We ﬁnd that positive U.S. monetary surprises led to declines in commodity prices, even as long-term interest rates fell and the U.S. dollar depreciated. In contrast, on days of negative U.S. monetary surprises, i.e. when markets evidently believed that monetary policy was less stimulatory than expected, long-term yields, the value of the dollar, and commodity prices all tended to increase.},

The sign restrictions rely on the high-frequency linkage between stock prices and interest rates surrounding the policy announcements.

Beyond the dollar appreciation channel, the effects are larger for highly storable and industrial commodities, consistent with the cost of carry and the expected demand channel. We then study the quantitative importance of the commodity-price channel of monetary policy on domestic and international inflation at longer horizons (6-36 months). The results indicate that the response of commodity prices—oil, base metals, and food prices—to monetary policy accounts for 47\% of the total effect of US monetary policy on US headline inflation, and 57\% of the effect of US monetary policy on other countries’ headline inflation. The commodity price channel on core inflation is smaller and mainly driven by base metal prices. Finally, the commodity-price channel of ECB monetary policy is smaller, and it mainly operates through its effect on energy prices.},

The model features oil as a complementary good for households and as a complementary input for firms. It also allows for unemployment and real wage rigidity. We estimate the key parameters by matching model impulse responses to those from identified money and oil shocks in a structural VAR. We then show that our model does a good job of explaining unemployment and inflation since 2010, including the recent inflation surge that began in mid 2021. We show that mainly accounting for this surge was a combination oil price shocks and “easy” monetary policy, even after allowing for demand shocks and shocks to labor market tightness. Important for the quantitative impact of the oil price shock is a low elasticity of substitution between oil and labor, which we estimate to be the case.},

As Quantitative Easing allowed the U.S. economy to stabilize and return to slow growth, oil prices increased and averaged \$100 during 2010-13. Then in June 2014, they plunged again dramatically to \$40. This paper proposes a model that describes the price of oil as depending on six inputs: Federal Assets accumulated by the Fed during the period of Quantitative Easing, the 10-Year Treasury Note rate, the price of copper, the Trade Weighted dollar, the S\&P 500 Index and the U.S. High Yield Rate for Bonds rated CCC or below. Making use of 771 overlapping 52-week regressions to capture short run dynamics we find that Quantitative Easing was statistically significant only during 2009-10, while the U.S. High Yield Rate played a more significant role, both during and after the crisis.},

Estimation results show that monetary policy surprises have economically important and highly signiﬁcant effects on the level and volatility of energy futures prices and their trading volumes. I ﬁnd that, on average, a hypothetical unanticipated 100-basis-point hike in the federal funds target rate is associated with roughly a 3\% decrease in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices. I also document that, in a narrow window around the FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve's LSAP1 and LSAP2 programs have a cumulative ﬁnancial market impact on crude oil equivalent to an unanticipated cut in the federal funds target rate of 156 basis points.},

We analyse the period from January 1999 to December 2020, which includes the financial crisis that started in August 2007. Our results show a significant response for oil returns only during the financial crisis. Specifically, we find that Brent crude oil futures’ returns responded negatively to unexpected variations in the Italian risk premium as a measure of unconventional monetary policy actions – and positively to unexpected variations in short-term interest rates. That is, an unexpected increase in short-term interest rates and reductions in the Italian risk premium are taken as positive signals anticipating the end of the financial crisis. Moreover, as Brent is priced in US dollars, we have tested if the Brent response is due to the exchange rate response. We find that the null hypothesis of equal response from Brent and the exchange rate to ECB monetary policy announcements cannot be rejected. These are important results for monetary policy makers and financial agents.},

A policy of the same name had previously been implemented in Japan, which serves as a reference. While the majority of the previous literature has measured the effectiveness of QE by its impact on interest rates, in this paper the effectiveness of all Bank of England policies, including QE, is measured by their impact on the declared goal of the QE policy, namely nominal GDP growth. Further, unlike other works on policy evaluation, in this paper we use the general-to-speciﬁc econometric modelling methodology (a.k.a. the ‘Hendry’ or ‘LSE’ methodology) in order to determine the relative importance of Bank of England policies, including QE. The empirical analysis indicates that QE as deﬁned and announced in March 2009 had no apparent effect on the UK economy. Meanwhile, it is found that a policy of ‘quantitative easing’ as deﬁned in the original sense of the term (Werner, 1995c) is supported by empirical evidence: a stable relationship between a lending aggregate (disaggregated M4 lending, singling out bank credit for GDP transactions) and nominal GDP is found. The ﬁndings imply that the central bank should more directly target the growth of bank credit for GDP-transactions, which was still contracting in late 2011. A number of measures exist to boost it, but they have hitherto not been taken.},

            In a recent study, Kilian L. and Vega C. (2011) indicate that the daily price of crude oil is mostly unresponsive to macroeconomic news, and at times exhibits response‐coefficients that are counterintuitive. The authors conclude that the price of crude oil is predetermined to macro aggregates, and hence determined in a flow demand/supply framework. We make the argument that inferences on commodity price determination should be drawn from news responses only after the standard tests are subject to inventory (or stock) controls. Using daily and intraday price data and proxies for inventory levels, we reexamine the responsiveness of crude prices to macroeconomic news. Our evidence suggests a very limited role for stock levels in the responsiveness of crude oil. The prior conclusion that crude oil is priced primarily in a flow‐environment is supported by our data. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark 32:536–559, 2012},

	abstract = {Central bank announcements simultaneously convey information about monetary policy and the central bank's assessment of the economic outlook. This paper disentangles these two components and studies their effect on the economy using a structural vector autoregression. It relies on the information inherent in high-frequency co-movement of interest rates and stock prices around policy announcements: a surprise policy tightening raises interest rates and reduces stock prices, while the complementary positive central bank information shock raises both. These two shocks have intuitive and very different effects on the economy. Ignoring the central bank information shocks biases the inference on monetary policy nonneutrality.

It is applied to the Japanese situation and was published in 1995, presenting a new concept of monetary policy, dubbed by the author 'quantitative monetary easing', or short, as also mentioned in the text, 'quantitative easing'. The definition of this concept is to expand the quantity of total credit creation, especially used for GDP transactions. Unsustainable asset bubbles are seen as being caused by substantial credit creation in excess of nominal GDP growth. Central banks can intervene and by adopting quantitative easing end the banking crisis and stimulate a swift recovery.},
