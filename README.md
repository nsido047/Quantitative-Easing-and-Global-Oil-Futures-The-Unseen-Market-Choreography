# Quantitative-Easing-and-Global-Oil-Futures-The-Unseen-Market-Choreography
This study examines the impact of unconventional monetary policies, specifically quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative tightening (QT), on daily WTI
and Brent futures return. Focusing on announcements from the Great Recession to COVID-19 by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of Eng-
land, the research investigates how these policies influence the daily returns of oil futures. Key transmission channels, such as foreign exchange, economic expectations, supply, and investor displacement, are highlighted. Empirical evidence shows that Federal Reserve LSAP announcements primarily affect WTI futures the day after through the exchange rate and economic expectation channels, with effect of -2.95 and -0.16 log percentage points, respectively. Similar effects are observed for Bank of England and European Central Bank announcements on Brent Crude futures. Additionally, open interest changes in oil futures contracts surrounding policy announcements show greater variability for easing announcements compared to tightening suggesting there is more economic uncertainty surrounding oil when QE is announced.
